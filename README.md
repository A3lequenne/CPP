# C++ Modules - A Comprehensive Learning Journey

## Overview
Welcome to the **C++ Modules** repository! This repository is structured to provide an in-depth learning experience of C++ through a series of modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the language. The exercises in these modules guide you step-by-step through core concepts of C++ such as object-oriented programming, templates, polymorphism, and more advanced topics.

Each module is a standalone directory containing detailed exercises and explanations, and they are designed to be taken in sequence to build a solid foundation in C++ programming. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to refresh your C++ skills, this repository will help you enhance your understanding and coding abilities.

## How to Use This Repository
- Navigate to each module folder to access the exercises and examples.
- Each module contains a `README.md` file with a detailed explanation of the concepts covered and how to complete the exercises.
- Use the provided `Makefile` in each module to compile the exercises.

## Getting Started
If you're new to C++, start with [CPP Module 00](CPP/CPP00) and work your way through the modules in sequence. Each module builds upon the concepts learned in the previous ones, making the learning curve smooth and intuitive.

For a complete overview of all modules and detailed documentation, see the [README.md in the root of the CPP folder](CPP/README.md).

Happy coding!
